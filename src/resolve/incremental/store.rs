//! Stateful incremental Tier-B resolution store.

//! rebuilds ONLY that file's subgraph (the per-file build never looks at any

//! untouched. Derived cross-file state selectively restitches only references
//! affected by changed definitions; [`graph`] reads that stored state.

//! The store wraps the SAME per-file build and stitch passes the batch
